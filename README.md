## Context

In the past five years, Morocco has faced a significant drought, with minimal rainfall affecting various aspects of life, from agriculture to water resources. Concerned about the impact of these weather patterns on communities, I embarked on creating this project. The idea behind it was simple yet powerful: to provide easy access to weather forecasts so that individuals and communities can anticipate and prepare for the possibility of rain. By developing this project, I aimed to empower people with the information they need to adapt to changing weather conditions and mitigate the challenges posed by prolonged periods of drought.
